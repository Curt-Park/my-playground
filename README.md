# My Self-Hosting Services

A Docker-based homelab infrastructure for self-hosting services with centralized authentication, automated SSL certificate management, and Cloudflare integration. Services are deployed as Portainer stacks, providing a clean separation of concerns and easy management through a web UI.

The infrastructure uses Traefik as a reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS via Let's Encrypt (DNS challenge), Authentik for SSO and forward authentication, and Cloudflare for DNS management and DDoS protection.

## Main Features

**Centralized Authentication**
- **Authentik SSO**: Enterprise-grade identity provider with forward authentication
- Single sign-on across all services via Traefik middleware
- OAuth2/OIDC support for service integrations

**Network & Reverse Proxy**
- **Traefik v3**: Modern reverse proxy with automatic service discovery
- Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt (DNS-01 challenge via Cloudflare)
- Wildcard SSL certificates for `*.${DOMAIN}`
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect on all services

**Cloudflare Integration**
- **traefik-cloudflare-companion**: Automatic DNS record management for Traefik services
- **cloudflare-ddns**: Dynamic DNS updates for home IP changes
- Cloudflare proxy for DDoS protection and CDN caching

**Infrastructure Management**
- **Portainer**: Web UI for managing Docker stacks and containers
- Google Drive Desktop sync for `$HOME/docker_volumes` backup
- Stack-based deployment (init, network, authentik, services)
- Environment variable configuration via `.env`

**Services**
- **n8n**: Workflow automation with task runners
- **Clawdbot**: Personal AI assistant across messaging channels
- **Monolithic backend**: Supporting microservices for other applications
